# Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify potential security threats in network communication.

## Dataset

The NSL-KDD dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for intrusion detection.

## Algorithms

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes

## Workflow
- Preprocess data, including one-hot encoding and standardization.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Visualizations
- Generated confusion matrices for model performance overview.
- Accuracy were shown in histograms for three algorithms.
- Training & Testing time was also illustrated in bar charts.
